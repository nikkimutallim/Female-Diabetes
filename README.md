# Female Diabetes


In this project, we have taken the data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set. 

All patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The variables are:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)

And the dependent variable: Class variable (0 or 1) = whether a person has diabetes

Since our outcome is a dummy variable, we utilized a Multinomial Regression Model
