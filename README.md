# Female Diabetes
Statistics/Data Visualization Project

In this project, we have taken the data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set. 

All patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The variables are:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)

And the dependent variable: Class variable (0 or 1) = whether a person has diabetes

Since our outcome is a dummy variable, we utilized a Multinomial Regression Model
